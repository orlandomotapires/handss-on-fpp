# Hands-on Supercomputing with Parallel Computing

In this repository, you will find solutions to exercises proposed by Professor [Murilo Boratto](https://github.com/muriloboratto) in the Parallel Programming Fundamentals course. Each Python notebook aims to cover a specific area of knowledge and contains various questions and challenges. The link to the professor's activity repository can be found [here](https://github.com/muriloboratto/hands-on-supercomputing-with-parallel-computing).

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide a series of Python notebooks with exercises and questions that enhance the understanding and mastery of various programming and data science concepts.

## Notebooks

Here is the list of notebooks available in this repository, each with its own learning objectives and answered challenges:
